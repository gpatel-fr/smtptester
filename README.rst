SMTP Tester
===========

Introduction
------------

I spent a long time searching for a tool that would help me troubleshoot SMTP
problems without having to resort to telnet. Finally, I gave up and wrote my
own.

Features
--------

- Tested on Windows and Linux (should run anywhere that Python runs)
- Graphical (no more telnet)
- Trace window showing live progress from DNS record look-ups through SMTP session
- Ability to override all DNS and SMTP settings
- Support for SASL and TLS
